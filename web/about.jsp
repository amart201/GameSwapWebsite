    <h2>A little About Us</h2>
    <p>At the moment, us is really just me. My name is Aaron Martin and 
        I started this site for a project in my Network Based Application
        Development class at UNC Charlotte. We had to create a site for 
        the exchanging of goods and I remembered how I always enjoyed 
        trading video games with friends. Old games that have been out of 
        production for a while can be especially difficult or expensive to 
        find so, I thought that a site for exchanging retro games was a
        good idea.
