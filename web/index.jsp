    <h2>Welcome to Retro Video Game Swap</h2>
    <p>If your into video games from the 80's and 90's, then this is the place for
    you. I know that sometimes it can be difficult to find games on old consoles like the Super Nintendo
    and Sega Genesis. It's not like you can just go to and big box store like Wal Mart and target and just
    by them, like you can with newer games, so I have created this site to help people to trade those hard
     to find, no longer manufactured, games.</p>
     <p>This site will host swapping for games from the original Nintendo(NES), the Super Nintendo(SNES),
         Nintendo 64, Nintendo Gameboy, Sega Genesis, Sega CD, Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, and Sega Gamegear.</p>
